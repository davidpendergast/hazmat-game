Game Mechanics
    
    
Level System
    + level files
        easily editable? use pre-existing level editor software? (Tiled? etc.) 
        for storing basic objects, spawn points, etc.
        json? whatever, doesn't really matter
            just list of ClassName + positions, really
            EntityReference objects for placement of special things
    
    + level class
        has an associated level file
        basic stuff loaded from file
        special stuff is created, each has a reference_id with associated 
            reference object in level file.
        and that's about it? insert player and start updating world
        
        level.load_into(world) -> 
        
    + save data
        one global dict that stores every single piece of save data
        no real structure, just data_string_tag -> data_value
        json-friendly values only
        loaded at launch, autosaved periodically
        loaded levels reference this to maintain state between loads/unloads
        
Light
    + colored lights
    + flickering lights
    + turning lights on and off
    ? ring of light around player      
          
    
    
    
    
Optimizations
    cache more stuff
        + rendered text
        + chunk backgrounds
    
Bugs
    Sprites aren't always being drawn pixel perfect, not sure why
