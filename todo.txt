General
    + key commands in their own file
        + later, make configurable


Player Mechanics
    + walking up/down stairs
    + stick to walls a bit when sliding
    + delay before sliding animation to prevent janky one framers on corner clips
    ? actionstates instead of booleans
    + walking off edge while crouching snaps player into wallslide


Start Menu
    + settings
    + continue
    ? m-m-m-m-microtransactions lol
        let's make the game first kiddo


End Game

Game Mechanics

Enemies
    + jumper
        jumps randomly, and when player gets near
    + flying
        not sure how it would pathfind, or how player could really kill it
        ghost-like enemy?

Entities
    + compulsory terminal
        or TextOverlay?
        how do you tell the player what the controls are in first level?
    + MessageZone
        displays text (without freezing game) while player is in zone
        "WASD to move"
        "K to interact"
        "J to shot"
    
Level System
    level editting
        + drag add and drag removal
        
    + save data
        one global dict that stores every single piece of save data
        no real structure, just data_string_tag -> data_value
        json-friendly values only
        loaded at launch, autosaved periodically/saved at save points
        loaded levels reference this to maintain state between loads/unloads

Puzzles
    + indication that puzzle has already been completed
    + difficulty settings
    + seeds for randomness

    ? block push puzzle
        move single pixel with WASD, push movable blocks to cover target positions
        X (=difficulty) retries before failure, infinite time

    ? subset sum
        cmon' this sucks


Art
    background
        + bigger background tiles to break up grid

    + figure out what to draw outside of levels
        just black? faded version of neighbors?
    
    running animations
        + pls make better it's painful to watch
    + more wall sprites
    + bullet splash in center of enemy
    + better looking health bar UI

        
Sound
    find and hook up lots of effects
        + walking
            + slower for crouch walking
        + jumping
        + landing
        + sliding
        + text show/dismiss
        + puzzle fail/success/quit
        + gain/lose health
        + door opening, door finish opening


Camera
    needs behavior that fits game a little better. Fixed camera is ok but not the best

        
Light
    + flickering lights
        this can be done pretty simply by just overriding the get_light_profile
    + turning lights on and off
    ? light when bullet hits walls
    ? configurable ambient light zones in levels
    + ambient light zones in levels
    + make it so anything can emit light (esp. machines)

    
Optimizations


Maintenence
    + seperate files for enemies, player, walls, misc stuff
    + logging framework

    
Bugs
    X can't jump while crouch-walking
        this is actually a problem with my keyboard, not the game
    X light entering nonexistant chunks is not rendered
        fixed by having nonchunks be solid black
    + can't turn around if standing in a 0.5 x 0.5 hole
    X knockback shouldn't play walking sprite
        fixed by having knockback force you airborn lol
    + crouch walking into a wall causes all kinds of sprite jitteriness
    + puzzle terminal textbox makes it difficult to activate puzzle

    secret areas

Level 1-2
    entering the facility, no real enemies
    just platforming, some danger (poison gas)
    scenery (offices, hallways) to reveal some story

Level 1-3
    slime enemies, crawling on the walls
    notable elements:
