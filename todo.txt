General
    + move decorations into their own file, make factory methods
    + key commands in their own file
        + later, make configurable


Player Mechanics
    crouching
        + crouch shooting
    walking up/down stairs
    stick to walls a bit when sliding

    
Game Mechanics
    damage
        + knockback and stun when damaged
        + death animation
            generated crumple effect? I ain't drawing all that
    enemies

    
Level System
    + level files
        easily editable? use pre-existing level editor software? (Tiled? etc.) 
        for storing basic objects, spawn points, etc.
        json? whatever, doesn't really matter
            just list of ClassName + positions, really
            EntityReference objects for placement of special things
    
    + level class
        has an associated level file
        basic stuff loaded from file
        special stuff is created, each has a reference_id with associated 
            reference object in level file.
        and that's about it? insert player and start updating world
        
        level.load_into(world) -> 
        
    + save data
        one global dict that stores every single piece of save data
        no real structure, just data_string_tag -> data_value
        json-friendly values only
        loaded at launch, autosaved periodically
        loaded levels reference this to maintain state between loads/unloads

Art
    background
        ? background move slower than foreground to add depth
        + bigger background tiles to break up grid

Camera
    needs behavior that fits game a little better. Fixed camera is ok but not the best
        
Light
    + colored lights
    + flickering lights
        this can be done pretty simply by just overriding the get_light_profile
    + turning lights on and off
    ? ring of light around player

    
Optimizations
    cache more stuff
        + rendered text
        + chunk backgrounds

    
Bugs
    Sprites aren't always being drawn pixel perfect, not sure why
    Can't jump while crouch-walking
    light entering nonexistant chunks is not rendered
