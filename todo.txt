General
    + key commands in their own file
        + later, make configurable


Player Mechanics
    + crouch shooting
    + walking up/down stairs
    + stick to walls a bit when sliding
    + delay before sliding animation to prevent janky one framers on corner clips
    + health system
    + actionstates instead of booleans
        

    
Game Mechanics
    damage
        + death animation
            generated crumple effect? I ain't drawing all that
    enemies
        + attacking

    
Level System
    level editting
        + ability to change items in keyboard slots
        + drag add and drag removal
        
    + save data
        one global dict that stores every single piece of save data
        no real structure, just data_string_tag -> data_value
        json-friendly values only
        loaded at launch, autosaved periodically/saved at save points
        loaded levels reference this to maintain state between loads/unloads

Puzzles
    + indication that puzzle has already been completed
    + damage for failing puzzle
    + puzzle render self on it's own surface
    + difficulty settings
    + seeds for randomness

    snake puzzle
        + score display

    + block push puzzle
        move single pixel with WASD, push movable blocks to cover target positions
        X (=difficulty) retries before failure, infinite time



Art
    background
        + bigger background tiles to break up grid

    + figure out what to draw outside of levels
        just black? faded version of neighbors?
    
    running animations
        + pls make better it's painful to watch
    + more wall sprites
    + bullet splash in center of enemy
    + better looking health bar UI

        
Sound
    find and hook up lots of effects
        + walking
            + slower for crouch walking
        + jumping
        + landing
        + sliding
        + text show/dismiss
        + puzzle fail/success/quit
        + gain/lose health
        + door opening, door finish opening


Camera
    needs behavior that fits game a little better. Fixed camera is ok but not the best

        
Light
    + flickering lights
        this can be done pretty simply by just overriding the get_light_profile
    + turning lights on and off
    ? light when bullet hits walls
    ? configurable ambient light zones in levels
    + ambient light zones in levels
    + make it so anything can emit light (esp. machines)

    
Optimizations
    cache more stuff
        + rendered text
    + all cached stuff needs to be in one place
        + and it needs to be cleared every so often to prevent memory leaks


Maintenence
    + seperate files for enemies, player, walls, misc stuff

    
Bugs
    + sprites aren't always being drawn pixel perfect, not sure why
    + can't jump while crouch-walking
    + light entering nonexistant chunks is not rendered
    + can't turn around if standing in a 0.5 x 0.5 hole
    + knockback shouldn't play walking sprite
    + *sometimes* light sprites are not rendered (caching issue probably)
